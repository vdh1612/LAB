# Pentest Labs - Server Exploitation with Metasploit & Nmap

Welcome to the **Pentest Labs** repository! This project provides hands-on labs designed to teach and enhance your skills in penetration testing, focusing on using tools like **Metasploit** and **Nmap**... to target the vulnerable servers.

## ðŸ“– About

This repository contains a series of labs that simulate real-world scenarios, where you'll learn to exploit vulnerabilities in server environments, specifically targeting Windows systems running Microsoft SQL Server 2014. These labs provide practical experience with various tools and techniques used in network and system exploitation.

The labs cater to both beginners and experienced pentesters, offering detailed instructions and opportunities for independent exploration.

### ðŸ’¡ Features:
- **Server-Specific Labs**: The labs are specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities in **Windows servers** with **Microsoft SQL Server 2014**.
- **Metasploit Integration**: Learn to use **Metasploit** to exploit known vulnerabilities in a controlled lab environment.
- **Network Scanning**: Use **Nmap** for network discovery, port scanning, and identifying open services on the target systems.
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Each lab replicates real-world security issues, including misconfigurations and known exploits.
