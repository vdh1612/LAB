# Pentest Labs - Learning and Practice

Welcome to the **Pentest Labs** repository! This project is designed to provide hands-on labs for anyone interested in learning and improving their skills in penetration testing. The labs cover various web application vulnerabilities, network security issues, and exploitation techniques, with practical examples for beginners and advanced learners.

## ðŸ“– About

This repository contains multiple labs that simulate real-world scenarios where common vulnerabilities are present. The purpose of these labs is to offer a safe environment to learn how to identify, exploit, and mitigate vulnerabilities found in modern web applications and systems. 

Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with ethical hacking or an experienced pentester wanting to refine your skills, these labs will help you grow your knowledge.

### ðŸ’¡ Features:
- **Beginner to Advanced Labs**: Labs ranging from simple vulnerabilities like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) to more advanced ones like SQL Injection, RCE (Remote Code Execution), and more.
- **Hands-on Practice**: Each lab includes step-by-step instructions to help you understand how to discover and exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Learning-Oriented**: Detailed explanations of the vulnerabilities, how they can be exploited, and remediation techniques to secure applications.
- **Whitebox Testing Focus**: Some labs include source code access to allow learners to explore the vulnerabilities from the developer's perspective, aiding in a better understanding of the weaknesses.
  
## ðŸ“‚ Lab Structure

Each lab has its own folder which includes:
- A **README.md** file that describes the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and tasks to complete.
- Sample vulnerable applications or configurations.
- Exploitation and mitigation guidance.

### ðŸ“š Current Labs:
1. **SQL Injection**: Learn how to exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities and protect your applications.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Understand how XSS attacks work and how to secure your web applications from them.
3. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**: Explore how IDOR vulnerabilities can be exploited and prevented.
4. **Remote Command Execution (RCE)**: Practice exploiting and patching RCE vulnerabilities in web applications.
5. **Authentication Flaws**: Learn about weak authentication methods and how to fortify them.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started with the labs, clone the repository and follow the instructions provided in each lab folder.
